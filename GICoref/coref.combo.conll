Cecil	(3)
's	-

if	-

Zacharie	(1)
smelled	-

out	-

something	-

Although	-
he	(1)
never	-
told	-
Cecil	(3)
where	-
he	(1)
came	-

hint	-
that	-
he	(1)

did	-
n't	-
come	-

Desert	-

because	-
xe	(3)
did	-
n't	-
instantly	-
hate	-
him	(1)

That	-
was	-
something	-
that	-
built	-
up	-
over	-

And	-
he	(1)
likely	-
had	-
n't	-
just	-
rose	-
out	-
from	-
the	-
sand	-
,	-
because	-
he	(1)
looked	-
more	-
like	-
he	(1)
had	-
torn	-
himself	(1)
out	-
from	-

judging	-
by	-

Cecil	(3)

Zacharie	(1)

something	-

that	-
no	-
one	-
could	-
put	-

Zacharie	(1)

Which	-
all	-
put	-
Cecil	(3)
's	-
nerves	-
relatively	-
at	-

Zacharie	(1)

the	(5

Cecil	(3)

made	-

to	-

in	-
for	-

and	-
he	(1)
went	-
right	-
under	-
the	-
radar	-
of	-
the	-
secret	-
police	-

Somehow	-

Improbably	-

Cecil	(3)
once	-
had	-

theory	-
that	-
Zacharie	(1)
worked	-
for	-
the	-
secret	-

xe	(3)
quickly	-
debunked	-

Zacharie	(1)
was	-

not	-

simply	-

too	-
shady	-

not	-

After	-
one	-
of	-
Zacharie	(1)
's	-
visits	-
,	-
after	-
he	(1)
leaned	-
close	-
to	-
Cecil	(3)

someone	-
