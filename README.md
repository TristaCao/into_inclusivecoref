Coreference resolution is a task of determining which textual references resolve tot he same real-world entityâ€”requires making inferences about those entities, especially when those entities are people.  In order to analyze what sort of gender biases exist in coreference resolution systems and crowd-worker judgments and move towards gender-inclusive coreference systems, we created twodatasets:  MAP and GICoref.
